﻿This code will find ADS-B radio signals from airplanes and plot them in real-time on your browser map. 
I find this interesting because it shows you the wide range of projects that GitHub has.

﻿﻿https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics

﻿These interesting set of sample codes are for robotics, written in Python. 
These could be used for a range of robotics controls like animation, mapping, and even different algorithms for your robot. 
This could be very useful in the future assuming we will one day all have a house robot.

﻿Bubble notifications with this code have the ability to explode. 
There are a few different effects besides just the explosion, but the explosion was the one I found the most interesting. 
This grabbed my attention because it shows you that you can change everything electronically around you using code.
